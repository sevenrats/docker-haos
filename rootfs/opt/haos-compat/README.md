# haos_compat

This container runs two compatibility shims:

- a tiny fake NetworkManager D-Bus responder
- a Docker UNIX-socket proxy that filters `/containers/json`, lightly tags `/info`,
  removes nested-LXC-incompatible options from container-create requests, and
  injects an idle udev monitor into Supervisor when required

`USE_UDEV_SHIM` controls Supervisor udev compatibility:

- `auto` (default): enable when root is mapped through a user namespace
- `force`: always enable
- `off`: disable

When compatibility is enabled, an existing Supervisor container created by an
older image is recreated once if it does not yet contain the shim. Persistent
Supervisor data is left intact.

The dummy NetworkManager service implements only the methods and properties that
Supervisor uses, with static data and minimal state updates.

Run on the session bus (default):
  python dummy-nm.py

To have Supervisor use the session bus instead of the system bus:
  export DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS="$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS"

Run on the system bus (requires permissions):
  python dummy-nm/service.py --bus system
